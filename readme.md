# Daniel Ellis's Portfolio Repo

## Purpose
This is a repo of my Portfolio website, which I shall be working on throughout the course of December for presentation to Startups and business's that may be interested in hiring me in Berlin. As such, this website will be written firstly in English, and through CSS and JS I shall be attempting to write my first multi-lingual website, for helping me to find a job as a Fullstack/Frontend/Backend Developer in Berlin.


## UI/UX
The UI and UX User stories for this website will be written in Adobe XD, as this enables quick and easy design tools to be utilised for the website. The wireframes can be found as both pdf and png formats for viewing in the wireframes folder.


## Features
The website is a single page application, which displays my competencies surrounding technologies that i've used, I will also incorporate JSMail to ensure bots dont get into my email address and therefore send spam.
